# Heterogeneous 3D NoC

<img style="width:25%;align=right" src="https://github.com/jmjos/heterogeneous-3D-NoC/raw/master/docs/figs/heterogeneous3DNoC.png">

This is the project repository containing a extensive suite of tools for the design of NoCs for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. We will provide:
- A lightweight and efficient implementation of a 3D NoC router 
- A NoC simulator with support for heterogeneous 3D SoCs. In includes a high-level model of the router.
- Design tools for NoCs targeting heterogeneous 3D SoCs.
